# Ask Ravi - Fighting modern slavery

A project for Hack'n'Lead ZÃ¼rich 2019.

Our team is addressing the Thompson Reuters challenge on modern slavery. You can see live demo [here](https://ask-ravi.netlify.com/).
The idea of the project is to raise awareness about modern slavery among Swiss school children. We created a chatbot where a imaginary child slave speaks about his life. 

The answers of the chatbot were compiled from real stories:
* [Ravi](http://www.endslaverynow.org/blog/articles/ravi-shanker-kumar)
* [Bithi](https://medium.com/@worldvisioncan/bithis-story-child-labour-in-the-textile-and-apparel-industries-40b6da0c1521)
* [James](https://www.endslaverynow.org/blog/articles/james-annan)

The chatbot answers a set of questions about 
* Ravi
* his family
* were he works
* his life
* his dream

Data was taken from 
* [Global Slavery Index](https://www.globalslaveryindex.org/2018/data/country-data/pakistan)
* [The Borgen Project](https://borgenproject.org/facts-about-poverty-in-pakistan/)

Team members: [TatianaPan](https://github.com/TatianaPan), [sigoetti](https://github.com/sigoetti), [kwahler](https://github.com/kwahler) 

This project was done with React and Dialogflow from Google.
